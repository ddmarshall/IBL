Also, this link has some tips on how to use GitHub Pages: https://python.plainenglish.io/how-to-host-your-sphinx-documentation-on-github-550254f325ae

1. To get docs set up need to ensure the python modules needed by sphinx are included (pyproject.toml)
2. run sphinx-quickstart
3. Edit the ReStructuredText files as needed
4. To generate rst files for new modules/code need to run sphinx-apidoc -f -o source/api ../..
5. Run make to generate HTML documentation
